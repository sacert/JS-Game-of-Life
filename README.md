# JS Game of Life

Very imple JS Game of Life implementation that uses a 100x100 grid and randomizes cell location. May be modified to create certain pieces such as a glider gun but left it to place random cells to see how the universe is created. May be tested at https://sacert.github.io/JS-Game-of-Life/
